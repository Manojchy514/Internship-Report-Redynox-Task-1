Task 2: Introduction to Web Application Security
Objective:
Learn about common web application vulnerabilities by analysing a simple web application. This task will help you understand how attackers can exploit weaknesses in web applications.

Skills:
Basic Web Security, Vulnerability Identification

Tools:
OWASP ZAP, DVWA vulnerable web application)

Guidelines:
1. Setup:
o Install and set up DVWA another intentionally vulnerable web application on your local machine.
o Ensure you understand how the application works and how to access it.

3. Perform Basic Vulnerability Analysis:
o Use OWASP ZAP to scan the web application for vulnerabilities.
o Focus on identifying at least one instance each of SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

5. Explore Vulnerabilities:
o Understand how each vulnerability works by reading the descriptions provided by OWASP ZAP.
o Attempt to manually exploit these vulnerabilities using basic techniques (e.g., inserting SQL code in a login form).

7. Report:
o Document each vulnerability found, including how you discovered it and why it is dangerous.
o Provide screenshots and a brief explanation of the exploitation process.
o Suggest simple steps that could mitigate these vulnerabilities.
